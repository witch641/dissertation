The abstract, table of contents, references, acknowledgements, academic achievements during the doctoral studies, and biography are laid out as first-level headings.

\subsection{Main body}
Chinese character font size: body font small 4 Song.

Foreign language, digital font size and peer Chinese font size of the same, font with WORD system Time New Roman body or similar fonts.

\subsubsection{Figure}
Illustrations include diagrams, schematics, construction diagrams, curves, block diagrams, flowcharts, layout diagrams, maps, photographs, plates, etc. Illustrations indicate items such as diagram number, diagram title, and legend. Figure number code with the chapter number. For example, "Figure 2.1" means the first figure in Chapter 2. Figure number and the text of the figure title placed between a word space, placed directly below the figure, the figure title with 5 words, font available in Song, shall be unified throughout the text. The text size of the symbols in the figure is not larger than the font size of the figure title.

The insertion of pictures in the paper is usually divided into a single figure and multiple figures, which are described below:

Single image insertion: Suppose the insertion name is \verb|tc_q_criteria|(the suffix can be .jpg, .png, .pdf, the same below) of the image, the effect as shown in the figure:
\ref{fig:tc_q_criteria}。
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{tc_q_criteria}
    \bicaption{Q判据等值面图，同时测试一下一个很长的标题，比如这真的是一个很长很长很长很长很长很长很长很长的标题。}{Isocontour of Q criteria, at the same time, this is to test a long title, for instance, this is a really very long very long very long very long very long title.}
    \label{fig:tc_q_criteria}
\end{figure}

If the blank area of the illustration is too large，such as \verb|shock_cyn|, will automatically crop to \ref{fig:shock_cyn}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    %trim option's parameter order: left bottom right top
    % \includegraphics[trim = 30mm 0mm 30mm 0mm, clip, width=0.40\textwidth]{shock_cyn}
    \includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{shock_cyn}
    \bicaption{激波圆柱作用。}{Shock-cylinder interaction.}
    \label{fig:shock_cyn}
\end{figure}

The insertion of multiple figures as Figure \ref{fig:oaspl}, multiple figures should not be given text sub-titles in the sub-figures, as long as the serial number is given, and the main title is cited in the description.

    \label{fig:oaspl}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Table}
The general format of the table is that the data are arranged vertically in order, and the content and items are read horizontally from left to right in a through layout. Table number is also coded with chapter number, e.g., Table 2.1 is the first table in Chapter 2. Table should have a table title, and table number between the empty 1 to 2 words, placed at the top of the table centered, with 5 Song font, shall be unified throughout the text. Table content and items in the font size is not larger than the font size of the figure title.

Please see table ~\ref{tab:sample}. For more examples of table making, please see  \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables}{WiKibook Tables}。

    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}%row space 
    \begin{tabular}{lcccccccc}
        \hline
        Row number & \multicolumn{8}{c}{This is a multicolumn} \\
        %\cline{2-9}% partial hline from column i to column j
        \hline
        Row 1 & $1$ & $2$ & $4$ & $5$ & $6$ & $7$ & $8$\\
        Row 2 & $1$ & $2$ & $4$ & $5$ & $6$ & $7$ & $8$\\
        Row 3 & $1$ & $2$ & $4$ & $5$ & $6$ & $7$ & $8$\\
        Row 4 & $1$ & $2$ & $4$ & $5$ & $6$ & $7$ & $8$\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:sample}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Equation}
Formulas include mathematical, physical and chemical formulas. Formulas, equations or equations cited in the text can be numbered by chapter number with Arabic numerals (formula number), such as: formula (2.1) that the first chapter 2, formula is generally a single line centered layout and the context is separated, formula number and formula peer right layout.

For example, Navier-Stokes equation: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ns}
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\rho\Vec{V}) = 0 \ \mathrm{times\ font\ test}\\
        \frac{\partial (\rho\Vec{V})}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\rho\Vec{V}\Vec{V}) = \nabla\cdot\Tensor{\sigma} \ \text{times font test}\\
        \frac{\partial (\rho E)}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\rho E\Vec{V}) = \nabla\cdot(k\nabla T) + \nabla\cdot(\Tensor{\sigma}\cdot\Vec{V})
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial }{\partial t}\int\limits_{\Omega} u \, \mathrm{d}\Omega + \int\limits_{S} \unitVector{n}\cdot(u\Vec{V}) \, \mathrm{d}S = \dot{\phi}
\end{equation}

For common commands for mathematical formulas, see \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics}{WiKibook Mathematics}。artracom.sty encapsulates some common data types such as vector matrices. The advantage of this is that if you need to modify the display form of a vector one day, you only need to modify the vector definition in artracom.sty separately to achieve the full document modification.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

Please see \ref{alg:euclid}, for more detail, please see \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx?lang=en}{algorithmicx}。

\begin{algorithm}[!htbp]
    \small
    \caption{Euclid's algorithm}\label{alg:euclid}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \Procedure{Euclid}{$a,b$}\Comment{The g.c.d. of a and b}
        \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
        \While{$r\not=0$}\Comment{We have the answer if r is 0}
        \State $a\gets b$
        \State $b\gets r$
        \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
        \EndWhile\label{euclidendwhile}
        \State \textbf{return} $b$\Comment{The gcd is b}
        \EndProcedure
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Appendix}
The figures, tables, formulas, references, etc. in the appendix are numbered separately from the text, and are also numbered with Arabic numerals, but crowned with the appendix serial number before the digital. For example: Figure A.1, equation (B.3), etc.
\subsection{Unit of measurement}
The dissertation will always adopt the "Legal Units of Measurement of the People's Republic of China" issued by the State Council on February 27, 1984, and follow the "Methods of Using Legal Units of Measurement of the People's Republic of China". The various quantities, units and symbols used for naming in the dissertation must follow the provisions of national standards GB3100-82, GB3101-82, GB3102/1-13-82, etc.

The way of writing unit names and symbols can adopt international common symbols or use Chinese names, but adopt one uniformly and do not mix them.

\subsection{References}

The reference citation process is introduced with an example, assuming the need to cite the document named "Document Preparation System", and the steps are as follows:

1) Use Google Scholar to search for Document Preparation System, click Cite under the target entry, expand it and select Import into BibTeX to open the BibTeX index information of this article, and copy and add them to the ref.bib file (this file is located in the Biblio folder).

2) The first line of the index \verb|@article{lamport1986document,| in \verb|lamport1986document| that is, the label of this document (\textbf{Chinese document must also use the English label}, generally follow: surname pinyin + year + the format of the first word of the title pinyin), want to index this document in the paper, there are two types of indexing:

Text type: \verb|\citet{lamport1986document}|. As shown here \citet{lamport1986document}. 

Bracket type: \verb|\citep{lamport1986document}|. as shown here \citep{lamport1986document}.

\textbf{multi-document index separated by English commas}:

\verb|\citep{lamport1986document, chu2004tushu, chen2005zhulu}|. As shown here \citep{lamport1986document,chu2004tushu,chen2005zhulu}

More examples such as:

\citet{walls2013drought}According to ... The study of ... was first proposed. which on ... \citep{walls2013drought}, is a current Chinese ... The research area that has been rapidly developed \citep{chen1980zhongguo}. When citing multiple papers published by the same author in the same year, the year of publication is followed by
The year of publication is distinguished by lowercase letters, e.g., \citep{yuan2012lana,yuan2012lanb,yuan2012lanc}. When citing more than one article in the same place, mark them in order of the year of publication, and separate them by
semicolon to separate them. For example, \citep{chen1980zhongguo,stamerjohanns2009mathml,hls2012jinji,niu2013zonghe}.

When using the author-year reference style, the Pinyin of the author's name must be filled in the \textbf{key} field of the BibTeX indexing information (please refer to the ref.bib file) in order to make the list of documents sorted by Pinyin. The entries in the reference list (not sorted by number) are first sorted by language, in the following order: Chinese, Japanese, English, Russian, and other languages. Then, Chinese is sorted by hanyu pinyin alphabetical order, Japanese by the first author's last name stroke, and Western and Russian by the first author's last name initial. For example, Chinese \cite{niu2013zonghe}, Japanese \cite{Bohan1928}, English \cite{stamerjohanns2009mathml}, Russian \cite{Dubrovin1906}.

In this way, the indexing of the literature is completed. Please check the chapter of references in this document and see if it is that simple? Yes, it is that simple!

Different literature styles and citation styles, such as author-publishing year system (authoryear), sequential coding system (numbers), superscript sequential coding system (super) can be implemented in Thesis.tex on artratex.sty calls, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \footnotesize
    \item \verb+\usepackage[numbers]{artratex}+ $\%$ text: Jones [1]; bracket: [1]
    \item \verb+\usepackage[super]{artratex}+ $\%$ text: Jones super[1]; bracket: super[1]
    \item \verb+\usepackage[authoryear]{artratex}+ $\%$ text: Jones (1995); bracket: (Jones, 1995)
    \item \verb+\usepackage[alpha]{artratex}+ $\%$ text: unavailable; bracket: [Jon95]
\end{itemize}

The default reference style for the current document is \textbf{authoryear}. If you are in superscript (\textbf{super}) mode and wish to change the superscript to an embedded one at a specific location, you can use the

Text Type: \verb|\citens{lamport1986document,chen2005zhulu}|。

Shown as \cite{lamport1986document,chen2005zhulu}

Bracket Type: \verb|\citens{lamport1986document,chen2005zhulu}|。

Shown as \cite{lamport1986document,chen2005zhulu}
